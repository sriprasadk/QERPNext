- `work_order_id`: Unique identifier for the work order (Primary Key)
- `product_id`: Foreign key referencing the product to be manufactured
- `quantity`: Quantity of the product to be produced
- `scheduled_start_date`: Scheduled start date for production
- `scheduled_end_date`: Scheduled end date for production
- `status`: Current status of the work order (e.g., planned, in progress, completed)

### Work Order Steps

The system maintains steps involved in manufacturing processes.

#### Fields:

- `step_id`: Unique identifier for the step (Primary Key)
